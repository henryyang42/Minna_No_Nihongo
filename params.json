However, it turned out that the sdk seem to have some problem parsing Japanese and Chineses.\r\nTherefore, I use WebView instead and turn all PDFs into htmls so that I can read it from WebView.\r\n\r\nI also implement a mediacontroller to enable user to listen to the lesson recording.\r\n\r\nThis is considered as a practice to get familar with some Android APIs and concepts.\r\n\r\n###Things to be improved:\r\n- UI design\r\n- To reduce the the .apk size (too much audio)\r\n\r\n[みんなの日本語 Lessons PDF]( https://www.dropbox.com/sh/f3unjvmh6dmwnct/CO9TU6m31G)\r\n<br>\r\n[みんなの日本語 Apk download](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/113630504/Minna_No_Nihongo.apk)\r\n\r\n\r\n######みんなの日本語  All Rights Reserved.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
